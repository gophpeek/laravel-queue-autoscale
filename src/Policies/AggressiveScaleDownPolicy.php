/**
 * Policy that aggressively scales down to minimum workers when queue is idle
 *
 * Use Case: Cost-optimized workloads where rapid scale-down saves money during idle periods.
 * This policy immediately removes all excess workers when there are no pending jobs.
 *
 * Example:
 * - Bursty/sporadic workloads (marketing campaigns, webhooks)
 * - Background processing (cleanup, analytics, reports)
 * - Development/staging environments
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Maximum cost savings during idle periods
 * - Rapid resource deallocation
 * - Ideal for workloads with clear idle/active patterns
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - Potential cold start delays when load returns
 * - More aggressive up/down cycling
 * - May be too aggressive for steady workloads
